<h2> Poor lonely little tea cup. Sat sitting all alone with no one to sip his delectable tea. No one to enjoy a laugh with.
  No one to hold his handle and take time to relax. Who or what will comfort this little funky cup?
  Maybe a little elephannt? </h2>

  <h3> I was inspired to make this tea cup because I love tea and I believe that everyone should enjoy it.
     From the young age of 3 the first lesson I learned was that you always need something warm in your tummy to start the day.
     So ever since then, every single morning my dad would send me to school with a travel mug of peppermint tea.
